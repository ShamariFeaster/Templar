<h2>Custom HTML Tags</h2>
Templar has the easiest API for creating custom HTML tags that the compiler will recognize and transform into whatever standard HTML you specify.

<h3>A Simple Example:</h3>

Suppose you want to create a tag called `<row>` that will stack on top of each other like a table's rows, but only using css.

<h4>Here's the JavaScript:</h4>

```
Templar.component('row',{
  templateURL : 'path/to/the/template.html'
});
```

<h4>Here's the template</h4>

```
<style>
.row{
  /*css stuff......*/
}
</style>

<div class="row"> 
  <content></content>
</div>
```

Each custom tag (or `component` as they're called in Templar) template can have a single `<style>` tag that Templar will inject. Be sure to use collision-resistant class names for your components as this is not implemented as the yet-to-be-standard Shadow DOM.

It should be noted that `<content>` tag of a template will be replaced with the innerHTML of a component during compilation.

<h3>A More Complex Example:</h3>

For a tag that has more complex behavior, Templar has a simple component lifecycle. `onCreate` and `onChange` functions for component attributes. This example is a stub of a component called an `OverlayButton`. This component allows a user to specify a transparent image that will be overlayed on top of a main image. The use case is an image that tells the user they can delete it by clicking it. It conveys this by overlaying a big red "X" on top of an image.

<h4>In use, the markup looks like:</h4>

```
<OverlayButton 
  overlay="image/icon/big-red-x.png"
  src="path-to-some-image.jpg">
</OverlayButton>
```

<h4>Here's the component template markup:</h4>

```
<div class="container">
  <a>

    <div class="transcluded-text">
      <content></content>
    </div>

    <img src="" id="main-image"/>
    <img src="" id="overlay-image"/>

  </a>
<div>
```

Our template has two `<img>` tags: one for the main image and another for the overlay. We make the image clickable by wrapping both images in an `<a>` tag.

In the component's JavaScript definition we can define its custom attributes and also the functions that control what happens when those attributes are changed at run-time.

```
Templar.component('OverlayButton', {
  templateURL : 'path/to/the/template.html'
  attributes : {

    overlay : function(self, val){
      var overlay;
      if((overlay = self.querySelector('[id=overlay-image]')) != null){
        overlay.setAttribute('src', val);
      }
    },

    src : function(self, val){
      var main;
      if((main = self.querySelector('[id=main-image]') )!= null){
        main.setAttribute('src', val);
      }
    }
  },
  onCreate : function(self){
    /* do some stuff */
  }
});
```

So if you were to use `jQuery.attr()` or plain JavaScript's `setAttribute()` to set the overlay attribute to a different source, the function called overlay that is defined above would be called and it would update the src attribute of the component's image tag.

I designed this process to be as close to native JavaScript as possible. there are no other options or complicated scoping or transclusion rules to remember. There may come a time when the limits of this simple approach are reached, but for now it's KISS all day.
