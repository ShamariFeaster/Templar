<h3>Use Routes and UI States</h3>

To support SPAs, Templar allows you to use anchor links as routes. When a user navigates to a 
anchor link that is a recognized route Templar will compile and load that route's partial HTML files 
into the specified `<div>`s.

```
Templar.Route([
/*This will compile/load into the defualt content div*/
{
    route : '#/route1',
    partial : 'partials/route1.html'
},
/*This will comile/load partial into specific div*/
{
    route : '#/route2',
    partial : 'partials/route2.html',
    target : '#some-div-id'
}];
```

A route can also be used to set model attribute data. This effectively functions as GET query parameters.

```
Templar.Route([
/*This will compile/load route1.html 
  then assigns whatever value is after #/route1/
  to modelName.attribName*/
{
    route : '#/route1/modelName:attribName',
    partial : 'partials/route1.html'
}];
```

A route can also be composed of other routes (although there are some best practices to keep in
mind when doing this). 

UI states allow you to decompose a UI into loosely coupled, re-usable
components.

<h4>Here's an example UI state:</h4>

```
Templar.Route([
{
  route : '#/main-layout',
  partial : 'partials/three-column-layout.html'
},
{
  route : '#/ad-search',
  partial : ['#/main-layout', 
    {
      partial : 'partials/Ad-Search/ad-list.html',
      target : '#layout-center-col'
    },
    {
      partial : 'partials/Ad-Search/ad-options-bar.html',
      target : '#layout-right-col'
    },        
    {
      partial : 'partials/main/sidebar.html',
      target : '#layout-left-col'
  }]
}];
```

This means that the various parts of you application's UI like the sidebar, navigation, and
main content area can be stored as separate partial HTML files. This makes for easier
maintenence and re-use of view components. 

For example if you are displaying the same list in multiple places, you can specify it as a 
component of multiple UI states as opposed to copying and pasting the list template mutliple places.

<h3>Onload events</h3>

You can specify and bind onload functions to the loading of routes or partial HTML files (which make 
up the components of routes), giving you a granular level of control. The handlers will not fire 
until all of a route or partial HTML file's content has been loaded, compiled, and, in the case of
repeated elements, built.

<h4>Using the above UI state example:</h4>

```
Templar.success('partials/Ad-Search/ad-options-bar.html', function(){
  /*do stuff after options bar is compiled/loaded*/
});

```

Suppose I want to do stuff after ALL components are loaded. Then I bind to the success of the route itself (as opposed to it's individual components). Simply change the first argument to the above function to `'#/ad-search'` Templar guarantees all of `'#/ad-search'`s components are compiled/loaded before firing any onload bound to the route.

<h4>Best practices</h4>
apl-default and when not to use it

only compose routes with other if the child routes don't have handlers attached.

although you can set a Model's state from anywhere, best practice
is to set an attribute using routing if the route makes use of that attribute. 
Don't do inter-route communication directly on a model.
