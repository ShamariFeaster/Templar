<h2>Custom HTML Attributes</h2>

You may want to add custom attributes to the `HTMLElement`'s on your page, or even to your custom 
tags (components). This process is even more simple than creating a custom component. 

<h3>Use Case</h3>  
You want to create an attribute that controls an `HTMLElement`'s visibility.

<h4>The code:</h4>

```
Templar.attribute('showIf',{

  onChange : function(self, val){
  
    if(val === false || val == 'false' || parseInt(val) > 0){
      self.style.visibility = 'hidden';
    }else{
      self.style.visibility = '';
    }
    
  }
});
```
Your `onChange` functions should have a prototype that looks like this:

<br/><br/>

`void onChangeCallback(DOMNode self, Any value)`

<br/><br/>

`self` is the node the attribute was set on. `value` is the value of the attribute. 

<br/><br/>

Now I can bind a data model attribute to the value of the `showIf` attribute on some element like so:

`<div showIf="{{Helper.signedIn}}">Welcome User</div>`

Now I can contorl the visibilty of this element by programmatically setting the value of 
`{{Helper.signedIn}}`. Using this attribute I've managed to keep logic out of my view and put 
it in code where it belongs. I've also built myself a re-usable tool for all of my projects.
<br/><br/>
As a side-note, notice that the `onChange` handler for `showIf` checks for a numerical value. I wrote
this in so I can bind to a list length and the element will only show if the list presently contains
elements like so:

```
<h1 showIf="{{Helper.listLength}}">
  Header That Should Be Invisble When No Elements In List
</h1>
```
