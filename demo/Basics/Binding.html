<h1>The Basics</h1>

A Templar application consists of two things: data models and templates. Data models are
designed to contain only data - not functions. Data can be JavaScript primatives or objects.
They could even be functions but it's not considered best practice to store functions on
your data model.

<br/>

Templar data models are just plain JavaScript objects with a couple of built-in methods
designed to help you efficently modify and monitor your applications data.

<h4>Here's a data model</h4>
```
Templar.dataModel('Example',{
  aString : 'Hello World',
  numbers : [1,2,3],
  
  objects : [
      {text : 'uno', value : '1'},
      {text : 'dos', value : '2'},
      {text : 'tres', value : '3'}]
});
```

<br/>
Each property of a data model object is called a data model attribute (`DMA`).

<br/>

Templar's `DMA`s are designed to be bound into your application's templates. Template
are just plain-old HTML files. The HTML contained in your templates spring to life once you
bind Templar data models in them.

<br/>

Inside of a template, a data model acts as a variable. Whenever the value of that variable changes,
Templar will immediately update the output of that variable in your template. This is the time
and complexity saving aspect of Templar and other modern front-end frameworks.

<br/>

<h3>Using your data models in templates</h3>

To make use of `DMA`s in your template you use specially formatted variable called a nonterminal (`NT`).
It looks like this:
`{{Helper.aStringNT}}`. This style of `NT` is referred to as 'mustache bindings' because the curly
braces (`{{`) looke like little mustaches. The text inside the mustaces have the model name, followed
by a period, followed by the attribute of that model you wish to output or bind a DOM element to.

<br/>

<h4>Let's look at an example:</h4>

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  <!-- Using the data model defined above, the un-compiled template looks like -->
  The value of Example.aString is:  {{Helper.aStringNT}}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

Here's what it looks like to the end-user:

`The value of Example.aString is:  {{Example.aString}}`
<br/>
<br/>
Now change the value of Example.aString and watch Templar automatically update this page
to reflect the new value you type in:

<input value="{{Example.aString}}"/>

<h4>Hey, how'd you do that?! (2-way data binding)</h4>

Templar has what's called 2-way data binding. This means you can bind a `DMA` to DOM elements that 
get user input and the `DMA`s value will change instantly. Like this:

<br/><br/>
`<input value="{{Helper.aStringNT}}"/>`
<br/><br/>

Think of this as the inbound lane of a highway. Learn how to inbound  bind 
<a href="#/selects">selects</a> and 
<a href="#/selects">other inputs.</a>

<br/></br>

We can push data out to our template (ie, print `DMA` values to the screen) by sticking 
`{{Helper.aStringNT}}` in our markup (like we did above). This is out outbound lane.
Learn how to outbound  bind  <a href="#/repeats">lists and arrays.</a>

<h2>Use multiple data models, anywhere</h2>

Some frameworks have a concept of 'scope.' Usually all the data displayed on any given
part of your site must share a single scope. Usually the scope is a JavaScript object,
and it is passed by the framework to a controller
that handles the business logic of a given part of your app. 

<br/><br/>

Since Templar doesn't force you to use a controller-based architecture, you are free
to use whatever data you want, from whatever model you want, anywhere in your app. 
Templar allows you to declare multiple data models, which act as namespaces
for different types of data. This allows you to organize your app's data any way you want.

<h4>For example: </h4> 

You could create a model to store and access the data of a form in your app. You may also
want to create a model to hold all the data pertaining to a logged in user. These two sets
of data may very well end up o the same page in your app, but, from an organizational standpoint
, they are very different types of data; therefore it seems prudent to namespace them on different
model like so:

```
Templar.dataModel('UserProfile',
{
  userName :  '',
  uid : '',
  email : '',
  firstName : '',
  lastName : ''
});

Templar.dataModel('CommentForm',{
  commentText : '',
  posterUid : -1,
  submitText : 'Post',
  cancelText : 'Cancel',
  isWritingComment : false
});
```

`UserProfile.userName` is a piece of data you will probably output all over the place in your app,
so you can place a mustache variable `{{Helper.userName}}` anywhere you want. 

<br/><br/>

Your app's view are decomposed into partial templates, but that is only for organizational and re-use
considerations. Those partials are still part of the same application and might need access to either
output or set any part of your application's data. This is why there are no contraints on data
model usage between templates and directives.
