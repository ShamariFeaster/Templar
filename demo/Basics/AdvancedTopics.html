<h3>Saving and Loading Models</h3>

Although Templar is designed to hepl you build single page applications (`SPA`s)
, there are going to be time when a user might have to refresh the page. 

<br/>

`void Model.save()` and `void Model.load([string serializedJSON])` give you 
the ability to
save a nodel's state to `sessionStorage`; these functions make sure the 
application's state isn't lost if the user refreshes the page.

<br/>

`save()` is a makes a serialized copy of the model's attributes using `JSON.stringify()`.
`load()` uses the stringified copy stored in `sessionStorage` and feeds it to 
`JSON.parse()` to de-serialize the string back into JavaScript variables.

<h3>Authentication</h3>

`void Templar.setAuthenticator(function authenticater)` is passed a callback we'll call
`authenticater`. `authenticater`'s prototype looks like this:

<br/><br/>

```bool authenticater([object authenticationData])```

<br/><br/>

Once set, `authenticater` is stored as a private member of one of Templar's internal
classes and once 
initally set, it cannot be 
reset at run-time. Typically the function will POST a user's credentials back 
to the server, where they will be checked and a response will be given back to 
the client.

<h4>Example:</h4>

```
Templar.setAuthenticator(function(authenticationData){
  var cookie = this;
  
  $.ajax('myServer/authenticate.php',
    {
      username: authenticationData.userName,
      password : authenticationData.encryptedPassword
    },
    /*called on server response*/
    function(dataFromServer){
      cookie['authenticated'] = dataFromServer.isAuthenticated;

      if(cookie['authenticated'] == false){
        /*let user know authentication failed */
      }else{
        Templar.Route.open('/my-profile');
      }
    }
  );
});

```

<br/>

`authenticater` is executed by calling `Templar.Route.authenticate([object authenticationData])`.
Typically, this will be called in a click handler for a 'login' button.

<h3>Authorization</h3>

Before a UI state is shown, an assignable route authorization function is executed. 
This allows you to restrict certain UI's (and hence certain data) to a desired subset 
of users. The authorization function is private and once initally set, it cannot be 
reset at run-time.

<br/>

`void Templar.setAuthorizer(function authorizer)` is passed a callback we'll call
`authorizer`. `authorizer`'s prototype looks like this:

<br/><br/>

```bool authorizer([object data])```

<br/><br/>

 The context (or `this`) of 
`authorizer` will be private member of one of Templar's internal, unreachable
classes. We'll call the context `cookie`. `cookie` is used to store session 
private information about a user's session (such as whether or not they are logged
in, or have admin privileges). 

<br/>

The `data` argument that is passed to the `authorizer` callback contains a single 
property, `route` which is the signature of the route currently being loaded.
Using the information contained in `cookie` and `data.route`, `authorizer` can 
contain logic that determines whether a user is authorized to have access to 
`data.route`.

<br/>

<h4>Example: </h4>

```
Templar.setAuthorizer(function(data){
  var cookie = this,
      url = data.route,
      isAuthorized = false;
      
  function isSignedIn(){
    return (cookie['authenticated'] == true);
  }
  
  /*Users are always allowed access to the login route*/
  if(url.indexOf('#/login') == 0){
    isAuthorized = true;
  }
  
  /*Users must be signed in to see their profile*/
  else if(url.indexOf('#/my-profile') == 0 || url.indexOf('#/editProfile') == 0){
    isAuthorized = isSignedIn();
  }
  
  return isAuthorized;

});

```
