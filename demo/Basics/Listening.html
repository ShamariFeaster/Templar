<h2>Listening for changes in your model</h2>

Re-assigning your model attribute data will automatically update your view. Changes in your
view, like user input, are instantly reflected in your data model. Re-assinging a list that
is bound to your view will rebuild that list to reflect the new list items. Templar
takes care of all the DOM manipulation.

<br/><br/>

From the user's perspective, Templar makes both application data and the DOM the same thing;
so rather than listening to changes in the DOM, you use the Templar API to listen for changes to
a data model attribute.

For example, if you are listening to a data model attribute named 'Animals' that is bound to a 
`&lt;select>` tag, to print out a end-user's selection do this:

<br/><br/>

```
DataModelName.listen('Animals', function(e){
  console.log('The user selected: ' + e.value);
});
```

`listen` looks and works exactly like traditional JavaScript event handling. The event object passed
to your event handler looks like this:

<br/><br/>

```
Event = {
  text : string,
  value : any,
  type : string,
  target : DOMNode, /*DOM element that triggered the event*/
  properties : Array
}

```
Remember that our listeners are fired whenever the DOM element our `DMA` is bound to is updated in 
some way. For a `DMA` bound to an `<input>`'s `value` attribute,  the listener would fire `onkeyup`.
For a `DMA` bound to a `&lt;select>`, the listener would fire `onchange`. 

<br/><br/>

For `DMA`s bound to `&lt;select>` and `<input type="checkbox"/>`, `Event.text` and `Event.value` can
have different values. For all other elements,  `Event.text` and `Event.value` are interchangable.

<h4>Explanation of Event.properties</h4>

Assume we have a data model that looks like this:

```
Templar.dataModel('TodoList',{
  items :[ 
    {
      text : '', 
      markCompleteCheckbox : ['complete?']
    }]
});
```

<br/><br/>

There's a single item in our todo list. The template to display our todo list items looks like this:

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

  <ul>
  
    <li data-apl-repeat="{{Helper.items}}">
      <input type="checkbox" value="{{markCompleteCheckbox}}" index="{{$index}}"/>
      <span>{{text}}</span>
    </li>
    
  </ul>
  
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

<br/><br/>

Each item has a checkbox that allows the user to mark it as complete. We bind a sub-property of a
todo item (`markCompleteCheckbox`) to a checkbox. We would like to be notified when that checkbox
has been changed, but we can't do this:

```
TodoList.listen('items[0].markCompleteCheckbox', function(e){
  /*do stuff......*/
});
```

<br/><br/>

Even if we could it wouldn't be very useful. It would only listen for changes to the first item's 
checkbox. What syntax could we use to generically represent the element index, which in this case is
'0'? An 'x' maybe? How about a 'y'? Or maybe a '*'? All of these symbols would just be arbitrary 
and increase the complexity of the listening system for both users and the framework.

<br/></br>

Rather than create an abstract mini language for binding listeners, Templar will simply
pass a stack of the sub-properties to your listener. 

<br/><br/>

Getting back to the example, how do we listen for changes to that checkbox? 
This is where `Event.properties` comes into play.
We listen to changes in `TodoList.items` but, using `Event.properties` we are able to distinguish 
if the change happened to a DOM element that is bound to a sub-property of `TodoList.items`. In this
case we want to know if the value of an indiviual items's `markCompleteCheckbox` sub-property has
changed due to the DOM element it's bound to being changed/updated.

<h4>Here's how we would do this </h4>

```
TodoList.listen('items', function(e){
  if(e.properties.pop() == 'markCompleteCheckbox'){
    /*we know the sub-property that changed was 'markCompleteCheckbox'*/
    
    /*do stuff with that info*/
  }
});
```

`Event.properties` is a stack that contains the sub-properties of `items` that the DOM element that
triggered the change event was bound to. In this case the checkbox was bound to 
`items[0].markCompleteCheckbox`
so `Event.properties` looks like this: `['0', 'markCompleteCheckbox']`. 

<br/><br/>

This is designed to keep the complexity of the listening system down for both the you and the 
framework. Listen to the `DMA` and use the information passed to distinguish sub-properties on your own
. This as opposed to you having to rememeber another abstract syntax for setting up listeners 
to sub-properties.
